## Problem Statement

Your customers shouldn't have to guess if your service is down. When issues happen, they flood your support inbox asking "Is it just me?" or worse, they assume the worst and look for alternatives.

---

## Solution Overview

Status pages give your customers a single place to check service health. Real-time updates, historical uptime data, and a professional presentation that builds confidence in your reliability.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Status Updates
Your status page automatically refreshes every 60 seconds, showing live status for all your monitored services. No manual updates needed - when your monitors detect an issue, your status page reflects it immediately.

**Status indicators:**
- Online (green) - Service is responding normally
- Degraded (amber) - Service is slow or partially available
- Offline (red) - Service is not responding
- Redirect (blue) - URL is redirecting
- Paused (yellow) - Monitoring is paused

### 2. 30-Day Heartbeat History
Every check displays a 30-day visual history showing daily status. Your customers can see at a glance how reliable your services have been over the past month - building trust through transparency.

### 3. Choose What to Display
Select exactly which checks appear on your status page. Show customer-facing services while keeping internal infrastructure private. Group checks by folder to organize services logically.

### 4. Multiple Layout Options
Choose the layout that fits your needs:
- **2-column grid** - Balanced view, works for most use cases
- **3-column grid** - Compact view for many services
- **Single column** - Clean, focused presentation

### 5. Public or Private
Set your status page as public for customers to access, or keep it private for internal team visibility only.

## Built-in Display Features

### Fullscreen Mode
Perfect for NOC displays, office dashboards, or TV monitors. One click expands the status page to fullscreen with a clean, distraction-free view.

### Sound Alerts
Enable audio alerts and get an audible notification when any service goes offline. Ideal for keeping a status page open on a secondary monitor while you work.

### Browser Tab Alerts
When a service goes down:
- The page title changes to show which service is offline
- The favicon pulses with a red indicator
- You'll notice even if the tab is in the background

### Auto-Refresh Countdown
A visible countdown shows when the next refresh will happen, so your team knows exactly how fresh the data is.
