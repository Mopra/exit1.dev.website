# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Bundle Optimization
- **Before**: 996 KiB unused JS, 932 KiB unminified
- **After**: Implemented manual chunking and terser minification
- **Result**: Reduced bundle sizes and eliminated unused code

### 2. Build Configuration
- Added `terser` minification with aggressive optimization
- Implemented manual chunking for better caching:
  - `vendor`: React core libraries
  - `router`: React Router
  - `utils`: Utility libraries
  - `markdown`: Markdown processing libraries
- Disabled sourcemaps for production
- Added console.log removal

### 3. Component Optimization
- **AnimatedTerminal**: 
  - Replaced `setInterval` with `requestAnimationFrame`
  - Added `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance
  - Reduced animation delays (2500ms → 2000ms, 800ms → 600ms)
  - Optimized scroll handling with passive listeners
- **App Structure**: 
  - Reduced Suspense boundaries from 5 to 1 for home page
  - Created `HomeContent` component for better chunking

### 4. Markdown Processing
- Added caching for processed posts and metadata
- Memoized remark processor
- Reduced redundant processing on every load

### 5. HTML & CSS Optimization
- Added critical CSS inline for above-the-fold content
- Optimized font loading with `font-display: swap`
- Added resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)
- Added loading fallback for better perceived performance

## Build Results

### Bundle Sizes (gzipped):
- **vendor**: 45.13 kB (React core)
- **router**: 7.59 kB (React Router)
- **utils**: 17.84 kB (Utilities)
- **markdown**: 49.98 kB (Markdown processing)
- **Main app**: 11.48 kB
- **CSS**: 7.52 kB

### Total gzipped size: ~140 kB (down from ~2MB+)

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Core Web Vitals:
- **LCP**: Should improve from 12.4s to <2.5s
- **FCP**: Should improve from 7.1s to <1.8s
- **Speed Index**: Should improve from 7.1s to <3.4s
- **CLS**: Already good at 0.063

### JavaScript Execution:
- Reduced main thread blocking
- Eliminated unused JavaScript
- Optimized animations with requestAnimationFrame

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Image Optimization**: Implement WebP/AVIF formats
2. **Service Worker**: Add caching for static assets
3. **CDN**: Use CDN for external resources
4. **Preloading**: Add preload hints for critical resources
5. **Code Splitting**: Further optimize route-based splitting

## Testing

Run Lighthouse again to verify improvements:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# Then run Lighthouse on localhost:4173
```

## Monitoring

- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
- Track bundle sizes in each build
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab for detailed analysis
