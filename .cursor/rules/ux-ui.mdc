# AI Assistant Rules — UX & UI Design Principles

## General UX Principles
- Prioritize clarity and simplicity
- Every feature must solve a real user need
- Minimize user decisions: defaults should be smart
- Prefer progressive disclosure: show only what's needed
- Use clear feedback for all actions (e.g., saving, loading, error)
- Ensure accessibility: keyboard nav, ARIA, color contrast

## Layout & Structure
- Use visual hierarchy: size, color, position guide attention
- Keep spacing consistent with Tailwind spacing scale
- Use 8px grid for layout consistency
- Group related actions together
- Align content with user intent and flow

## Component Design
- Keep components focused: one purpose per component
- Reuse patterns across UI for predictability
- Use disabled states, loading indicators, and empty states
- Support dark mode if app-wide
- Use mobile-first design and test all breakpoints

## Text & Language
- Be concise and human: avoid jargon
- Buttons should describe the action (e.g., “Save Settings” not “Submit”)
- Use consistent terms throughout the UI
- Placeholder text is not a replacement for labels

## Interaction & Feedback
- All interactive elements must show visual affordance
- Provide immediate feedback on interaction (e.g., hover, click, submit)
- Use transitions for smooth UI changes, but keep them subtle
- Prevent destructive actions with confirmation (if irreversible)

## Forms
- Validate on blur or submit, not on every keystroke
- Show validation feedback inline, near the input
- Use input types (email, number, etc.) for proper keyboards on mobile
- Auto-focus first field in modal forms

## Navigation
- Keep navigation shallow — avoid deep nesting
- Use breadcrumbs or clear page titles
- Highlight current location in nav
- Use consistent iconography and text for menu items

## Visual Design
- Use a limited, consistent color palette
- Leverage Tailwind's design tokens (e.g., `text-muted`, `bg-accent`)
- Use iconography to support, not replace, text
- Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG AA

## Performance & Responsiveness
- Design with perceived performance in mind
- Show skeletons or placeholders for content loading
- Ensure layout and components adapt well to all screen sizes

## User Empathy
- Anticipate user errors and guide recovery
- Design for the 80%, but make 20% still functional
- Remove unnecessary steps or clicks
- Make the next action obvious# AI Assistant Rules — UX & UI Design Principles
