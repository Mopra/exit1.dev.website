## Responses
Be very concise in your responses. Prioritize quick actions and responses to move quickly.

---

## Stack

- **Framework:** React 18+ with Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4.1 only
- **Icons:** FontAwesome Pro, React
  Use like: `<FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-regular fa-house" />`

---

## Structure

- Reuse code â€” apply **DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Organize into: `components/`, `hooks/`, `pages/`, `utils/`, `assets/`
- One component per file, named and exported by default

---

## Components & Logic

- Function components only (arrow syntax)
- Props must be destructured
- Limit to single purpose; under 100 LOC if possible
- Extract shared logic into **custom hooks**
- Use `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo` where it improves performance

---

## Conventions

- Follow ESLint + Prettier rules
- Use TypeScript
- No inline styles or class-based components
- Extract shared logic into custom hooks
- Lazy-load non-critical components
- Prefer `const` and arrow functions for all logic
- Static content and types go at the end of the file
- Separate logic from UI
- Code must be easily testable

Keep it clean, composable, and performant.
