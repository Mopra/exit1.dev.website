  const faq = [
    {
      question: "What metrics do you track in analytics?",
      answer: "We track uptime percentage, response times (average, min, max), incident counts, total downtime, Mean Time Between Incidents (MTBI), and Overall Reliability Score (ORS). All metrics are calculated in real-time and stored indefinitely for trend analysis."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are your analytics compared to Google Analytics?",
      answer: "Our analytics focus on infrastructure monitoring, not user behavior. We track server-side metrics like uptime and response times, while Google Analytics tracks user interactions. Both are valuable but serve different purposes. Our data is more accurate for monitoring website availability and performance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I export my analytics data?",
      answer: "Yes, you can export all your analytics data in CSV or Excel format. We also provide API access to programmatically retrieve your analytics data. There are no restrictions on data export or retention limits - you own your data completely."
    },
    {
      question: "How far back does your historical data go?",
      answer: "We store all your monitoring data indefinitely with no retention limits. You can analyze trends from years ago, compare performance across different time periods, and build long-term reliability reports. Most competitors limit historical data to 30-90 days."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide custom reports?",
      answer: "Yes, you can build custom reports focusing on the metrics that matter to you. Filter by time periods, specific websites, or performance thresholds. Create dashboards that show exactly what you need without the clutter of irrelevant metrics."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you calculate uptime percentage?",
      answer: "Uptime is calculated as (successful checks / total checks) × 100 for any given time period. We perform real HTTP requests, not just ping tests, so our uptime calculations reflect actual website availability to users."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between your analytics and other monitoring tools?",
      answer: "Unlike generic analytics tools, we focus specifically on infrastructure monitoring with real-time data, unlimited retention, and developer-friendly features. We don't track user behavior - we track whether your services are working and how fast they respond."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I integrate analytics with other tools?",
      answer: "Yes, our REST API allows you to integrate analytics data with other tools and dashboards. You can also set up webhooks to receive real-time analytics updates in your own systems."
