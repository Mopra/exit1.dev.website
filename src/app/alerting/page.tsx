  const faq = [
    {
      question: "How quickly do I get notified when my website goes down?",
      answer: "You'll receive alerts within seconds of detecting an issue. Our system performs real-time monitoring checks and immediately triggers notifications via webhooks and email when problems are detected. No delays, no missed alerts."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between webhooks and email alerts?",
      answer: "Webhooks send instant HTTP POST requests to your systems with detailed JSON payloads, perfect for integrating with Slack, Discord, or custom applications. Email alerts provide human-readable notifications with issue details and recovery information. You can use both simultaneously."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prevent alert spam and fatigue?",
      answer: "We use intelligent alert suppression that requires multiple consecutive failures before sending the first alert. We also limit alerts to one per check per event per hour to prevent spam. You can customize these settings based on your preferences and monitoring needs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the alert messages and payloads?",
      answer: "Yes, webhook alerts include detailed JSON payloads with website information, status codes, response times, and error details. You can also add custom headers to webhooks for authentication. Email alerts include comprehensive issue information and recovery suggestions."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you support HMAC signatures for webhook security?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide optional HMAC signatures for webhook payloads. This allows you to verify that alerts are genuinely from exit1.dev and haven't been tampered with. The signature is included in the X-Exit1-Signature header."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I test my alert configurations?",
      answer: "Absolutely. You can send test webhook payloads and test emails to verify your alert configurations work correctly. This helps ensure your integrations are set up properly before real issues occur."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when my website comes back online?",
      answer: "You'll receive recovery notifications when your website comes back online. These alerts include information about the downtime duration and help you track your service reliability. You can configure whether to receive recovery notifications separately from downtime alerts."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I set different alert rules for different websites?",
      answer: "Yes, you can configure different alert settings for each website you monitor. Set different recipients, notification channels, or suppression rules based on the importance and characteristics of each service."
    }
