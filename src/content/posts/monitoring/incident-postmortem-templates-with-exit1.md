# Incident Postmortem Templates Fueled by exit1.dev Logs

Postmortems shouldn’t be detective work. exit1.dev captures the evidence—timestamps, regions, status codes, recovery times—so you can write honest reports without rummaging through half a dozen tools.

## The bare minimum postmortem template

1. **Incident summary** – what broke and why it mattered.
2. **Timeline** – detection, alerting, response, mitigation, resolution.
3. **Impact** – affected users, duration, revenue/SLAs.
4. **Root cause** – technical and organizational.
5. **Follow-up** – tasks and owners.

exit1.dev gives you the data to fill every section.

## Pulling the evidence

### Logs

Export the monitor logs for the incident window. You get exact timestamps for failure and recovery, response codes, latency, and which regions saw the issue first.

### Alert history

Webhooks and emails provide the detection timestamps. Pair them with PagerDuty/Opsgenie events to show how quickly you responded.

### Analytics

Grab the uptime and response-time charts for the affected monitors. They make excellent visuals for stakeholders.

## Building the doc

Drop the evidence into your template (Notion, Confluence, Google Docs). The result is a postmortem with hard data, not guesswork.

- Include log snippets for first failure and last recovery.
- Add screenshots of analytics charts.
- Link to tickets for follow-up tasks.

## Continuous improvement

Use exit1.dev tags to group monitors by service. After each postmortem, review the tag analytics to see if response times drifted or if downtime clusters around specific regions. Feed that back into engineering priorities.

## FAQs

### Can I automate postmortem drafts?

Yes. Use the API to pull incident data and populate a template automatically. You can even trigger it via webhook when an incident resolves.

### Do I need a paid plan for history?

No. History is unlimited on the free tier.

### Can I share postmortem data with clients?

Export the relevant logs and analytics. Clients get proof that you handled the issue quickly.

### What if multiple monitors were involved?

Filter logs by tag or monitor group. Combine the data into a single timeline so the story is crystal clear.
