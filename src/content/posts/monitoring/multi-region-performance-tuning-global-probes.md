# Multi-Region Performance Tuning with Global Probes

Latency kills conversions. If you only monitor from one region, you’re blind to half your audience. exit1.dev’s global probes show you how fast—or slow—your site or API is from every corner, without charging for the privilege.

## Why global monitoring matters

- CDNs misbehave in specific regions.
- Cloud regions drift in performance.
- DNS routing can bounce users to the wrong edge.
- Compliance requires proof you’re watching international uptime.

## Setting up global probes

1. Add your monitors in exit1.dev (websites, APIs, workers).
2. Enable global monitoring in the settings.
3. Pick the regions that mirror your traffic (US, EU, APAC, LATAM, etc.).
4. Let the probes run every minute.

## Reading the data

Head to Analytics and break down results by region. You’ll see:

- Response time percentiles per region.
- Downtime frequency by geography.
- SSL and domain issues localized to certain zones.

## Acting on the insights

- Tune your CDN caching or edge rules for the slow regions.
- Re-evaluate DNS or traffic steering policies.
- Add more origin capacity where latency spikes.
- Prove to stakeholders that new regions improved the experience.

## Combine with alerting

Configure alerts that only fire when a specific region fails. Maybe APAC goes down but the rest is fine—you’ll know immediately and wake the right team.

## Report upstream

Export the regional data and share it with product, marketing, or leadership. Nothing shuts down guesswork faster than “APAC checkout latency dropped from 900ms to 210ms after we tweaked caching.”

## FAQs

### Do global probes cost extra?

No. Global monitoring is included. Pick as many regions as you need.

### Can I customize regions per monitor?

Yes. Choose different region sets per monitor. Critical APIs can run everywhere; smaller landing pages can focus on key markets.

### How granular are the analytics?

We keep full logs per region. Drill down to each request if you want. Export everything to CSV or the API.

### Does this work with APIs too?

Absolutely. Monitor REST, GraphQL, or webhook endpoints globally. You’ll spot latency spikes faster than your customers can tweet.
