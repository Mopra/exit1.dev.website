# Free SSL Certificate Monitoring: Protect Your Website Security

SSL certificates are critical for website security, but they expire regularly and can cause serious issues if not monitored properly. This guide shows you how to monitor SSL certificates for free and prevent security breaches, browser warnings, and service disruptions.

## Why SSL Certificate Monitoring is Critical

SSL certificates are essential for:
- **Website Security**: Encrypting data between users and your server
- **User Trust**: Displaying the padlock icon in browsers
- **SEO Benefits**: Google favors HTTPS websites
- **Compliance**: Meeting security requirements for various industries

### The Hidden Dangers of Expired SSL Certificates

When SSL certificates expire, the consequences can be severe:

- **Browser Warnings**: Users see scary security warnings
- **Service Disruption**: Some browsers block access entirely
- **SEO Penalties**: Google may demote your site in search results
- **Customer Trust**: Users may abandon your site due to security concerns
- **Revenue Loss**: E-commerce sites can lose sales during outages

## Setting Up Free SSL Certificate Monitoring

### Step 1: Choose Your Monitoring Tool

For most users, we recommend **exit1.dev** because it offers:

### Step 2: Configure SSL Monitoring

```bash
# With exit1.dev, SSL monitoring is automatic
# Just add your website and SSL monitoring is included

1. Visit https://exit1.dev
2. Add your website URL (https://yourwebsite.com)
3. SSL monitoring starts automatically
4. Set up alerts for certificate expiration
```

### Step 3: Set Up Alerts

**Recommended Alert Schedule:**
- **30 days before expiration**: First warning
- **7 days before expiration**: Urgent alert
- **1 day before expiration**: Critical alert
- **Certificate expired**: Immediate notification

**Webhook Configuration:**
```javascript
// Example webhook payload for SSL alerts
{
  "type": "ssl_expiry",
  "website": "https://yourwebsite.com",
  "expiry_date": "2025-03-15T00:00:00Z",
  "days_remaining": 7,
  "severity": "warning"
}
```

## SSL Certificate Monitoring Best Practices

### 1. Monitor Multiple Certificate Types

**Domain Certificates:**
- Main domain (example.com)
- Subdomains (www.example.com, api.example.com)
- Wildcard certificates (*.example.com)

**Certificate Authorities:**
- Let's Encrypt (90-day validity)
- Commercial CAs (1-2 year validity)
- Self-signed certificates (not recommended for production)

### 2. Set Up Proper Alert Thresholds

```javascript
// Recommended alert configuration
const sslAlerts = {
  "30_days": {
    "type": "warning",
    "message": "SSL certificate expires in 30 days"
  },
  "7_days": {
    "type": "urgent", 
    "message": "SSL certificate expires in 7 days"
  },
  "1_day": {
    "type": "critical",
    "message": "SSL certificate expires tomorrow"
  },
  "expired": {
    "type": "emergency",
    "message": "SSL certificate has expired"
  }
};
```

### 3. Monitor Certificate Quality

Beyond expiration dates, also monitor:

**Certificate Strength:**
- Key size (minimum 2048-bit RSA)
- Signature algorithm (SHA-256 or better)
- Certificate authority reputation

**Configuration Issues:**
- Mixed content warnings
- HSTS implementation
- Certificate transparency logs

## Common SSL Certificate Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Certificate Expiration

**Problem:** Certificate expires without warning
**Solution:** Set up monitoring with multiple alert thresholds

### Issue 2: Certificate Mismatch

**Problem:** Certificate doesn't match domain name
**Solution:** Monitor certificate subject alternative names (SANs)

### Issue 3: Weak Certificate

**Problem:** Using outdated encryption algorithms
**Solution:** Regular security audits and certificate updates

### Issue 4: Chain Issues

**Problem:** Incomplete certificate chain
**Solution:** Verify intermediate certificates are properly installed

## Advanced SSL Monitoring Techniques

### 1. Automated Certificate Renewal

```bash
# Let's Encrypt auto-renewal with monitoring
#!/bin/bash
# Check certificate expiration
certbot certificates | grep "VALID" | awk '{print $2}' | while read expiry; do
  days_remaining=$(( ($(date -d "$expiry" +%s) - $(date +%s)) / 86400 ))
  
  if [ $days_remaining -lt 30 ]; then
    # Renew certificate
    certbot renew --quiet
    
    # Send webhook notification
    curl -X POST https://api.exit1.dev/webhooks/ssl-renewed \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"domain":"example.com","action":"renewed"}'
  fi
done
```

### 2. Certificate Transparency Monitoring

```javascript
// Monitor certificate transparency logs
const ctMonitor = {
  "domain": "example.com",
  "logs": [
    "https://ct.googleapis.com/logs/argon2020",
    "https://ct.cloudflare.com/logs/nimbus2020"
  ],
  "alerts": {
    "new_certificate": "New certificate issued for domain",
    "unauthorized_cert": "Certificate issued without authorization"
  }
};
```

### 3. Multi-Domain SSL Monitoring

```yaml
# Monitor multiple domains with different requirements
domains:
  - name: "example.com"
    alert_days: [30, 7, 1]
    critical: true
    
  - name: "api.example.com"
    alert_days: [14, 3, 1]
    critical: true
    
  - name: "blog.example.com"
    alert_days: [7, 1]
    critical: false
```
