# Jamstack and GitHub Pages Uptime Without Agents

Jamstack should be boringly reliable, yet deploy pipelines, DNS hiccups, and bad cache headers still ruin launch day. You don’t need agents or synthetic browsers to keep your static sites awake. exit1.dev does it with raw HTTP checks, smart validation, and instant alerts—all free.

## Jamstack isn’t set-and-forget

Static hosting hides the complexity. Behind the CDN you still have:

- Build pipelines that fail silently.
- DNS records that drift or get flattened by a teammate.
- Edge caches serving 404s because someone purged the wrong path.
- Forms and APIs running on serverless endpoints that time out.

The fix is simple: monitor the whole flow.

## Set up monitoring in minutes

### 1. List your real entry points

Pick the pages that matter: `/`, top landing pages, pricing, docs, blog, and any region-specific domains. Add them all. exit1.dev doesn’t charge per monitor.

### 2. Validate the rendered output

Static sites can still serve broken builds. Use keyword checks for hero copy, meta tags, or JSON payloads from serverless APIs. If the new deploy serves the wrong text, we catch it.

### 3. Watch build endpoints and cron jobs

If you run scheduled builds or webhooks (Vercel ISR, Netlify functions, GitHub Actions), add those endpoints as monitors. We’ll hit them every minute, validate JSON, and tell you when a build pipeline stalls.

### 4. Guard SSL and custom domains

Custom domains on GitHub Pages or Netlify have a nasty habit of breaking when DNS settings change. exit1.dev tracks SSL certificates and domain expiry so you know before browsers start screaming.

### 5. Alert globally

Configure webhooks for PagerDuty or Opsgenie, keep a Slack channel for the marketing crew, and rely on email for long-tail notifications. Unlimited channels, still free.

## GitHub Pages specifics

GitHub Pages sometimes lags after new commits. Set monitors for the CDN endpoint and the `*.github.io` domain. If the custom domain fails, you’ll see it.

Use keyword validation to make sure the new Markdown made it to production. Add monitors for the sitemap and RSS feed so search traffic doesn’t quietly die.

## Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages

All three support instant rollbacks. Pair exit1.dev monitors with your rollback pipeline so you can revert before users tweet.

- Monitor the function endpoints powering forms or auth.
- Validate response time trends in exit1.dev analytics. Jamstack should be fast; if it’s not, you’ll know.
- Use tags to group monitors by project or region.

## What about staging?

Monitoring staging is free too. Add monitors for preview URLs, set slower intervals, and keep them labeled. You’ll catch environment drift before promotion.

## FAQs

### Does exit1.dev need an agent on my Jamstack host?

No. We’re 100% agentless. We hit your endpoints like a browser would.

### Can I monitor ISR or revalidation endpoints?

Yes. Add the revalidation URLs or internal APIs, assert the JSON payload, and we’ll alert when revalidation fails.

### How do I monitor multiple regions?

Create monitors per region or domain. exit1.dev runs global probes and shows performance per location.

### Can I export uptime data for stakeholders?

Yes. Analytics export to CSV/Excel or pipe through the API. Share the data without giving anyone admin access.
