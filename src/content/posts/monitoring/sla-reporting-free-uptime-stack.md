# SLA Reporting on a Free Uptime Stack

SLA reports usually mean enterprise contracts and bloated dashboards. That’s nonsense. exit1.dev gives you the raw data, analytics, and exports to prove uptime without signing a procurement novel.

## Know what you’re measuring

SLA math is simple:

- Define your window (monthly, quarterly).
- Track total downtime and response times.
- Document incidents with context.

exit1.dev handles the measurements. You just need to decide what story to tell.

## Step-by-step SLA workflow

### 1. Organize monitors by contract

Use tags for each client or internal service level. That lets you slice analytics for just the monitors that belong to a contract.

### 2. Pull availability numbers

Head to the Analytics page in exit1.dev and select your tag. Export the uptime percentage and response-time percentiles directly. No paywall.

### 3. Export incident logs

Download CSV logs for the period. They include start/stop times, status codes, and locations. Drop them into Google Sheets, Excel, or your BI tool.

### 4. Attach context

Add notes from your incident runbooks. You already get instant alerts via email or webhook; translate those into the report with root cause and remediation.

### 5. Share it

Send the PDF, share the spreadsheet, or publish the numbers in Notion. You didn’t pay a cent for the data, and you control the narrative.

## Automating the report

Use the exit1.dev API to fetch uptime summaries and logs. Combine it with your billing system or ticketing data. Because the API is part of the free tier, automation costs nothing.

## Extra polish clients love

- Include SSL and domain expiry dates so clients know you’re watching the boring stuff.
- Show regional breakdowns if they have global traffic.
- Highlight response-time improvements after each release.

## Stop renting visibility

Competitors sell “SLA dashboards” as add-ons. You don’t need them. exit1.dev gives you unlimited history and exports. Spend that money on engineering instead.

## FAQs

### Does exit1.dev limit how much data I can export?

No. Export as much as you want. The free tier doesn’t throttle data access.

### Can I schedule exports?

Yes. Use the API on a cron job or serverless function. Pull reports monthly and email them automatically.

### How do I include incident notes?

Store them wherever you like—Notion, Confluence, Git. Link to them in the report. exit1.dev gives you the timestamps to tie everything together.

### What if I need management-friendly charts?

Use the Analytics UI for at-a-glance charts or drop the CSV into your BI tool of choice. The data is portable by design.
