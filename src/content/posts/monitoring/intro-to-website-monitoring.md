- **99.99% uptime** = 4.32 minutes of downtime per month
- **99.999% uptime** = 25.9 seconds of downtime per month

```javascript
// Example uptime calculation
function calculateUptime(totalChecks, failedChecks) {
  const successfulChecks = totalChecks - failedChecks;
  const uptimePercentage = (successfulChecks / totalChecks) * 100;
  
  // Calculate downtime in minutes per month
  const monthlyMinutes = 30 * 24 * 60; // 43,200 minutes
  const downtimeMinutes = (monthlyMinutes * (100 - uptimePercentage)) / 100;
  
  return {
    uptime: uptimePercentage.toFixed(3),
    monthlyDowntime: downtimeMinutes.toFixed(1) + ' minutes'
  };
}
```

**Availability from Multiple Locations**
Monitor from at least 3-5 geographic locations to ensure global availability and distinguish between local and global issues.

### Response Time and Performance

**Response Time Metrics**
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Server processing time
- **Page Load Time**: Complete page rendering time
- **DNS Resolution Time**: Domain name lookup speed

Google's user experience metrics that impact SEO:
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Loading performance (target: <2.5s)
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Interactivity (target: <100ms)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Visual stability (target: <0.1)

### Error Rate and Reliability

**HTTP Status Code Monitoring**
```yaml
# Status code categories and their implications
status_codes:
  success: [200, 201, 202, 204]     # Successful responses
  redirect: [301, 302, 307, 308]    # Redirection responses
  client_error: [400, 401, 403, 404] # Client errors
  server_error: [500, 502, 503, 504] # Server errors

alert_thresholds:
  client_errors: 5%    # Alert if >5% of requests are 4xx
  server_errors: 1%    # Alert if >1% of requests are 5xx
  timeout_rate: 2%     # Alert if >2% of requests timeout
```

**JavaScript Error Monitoring**
Track frontend errors that impact user experience:
- Uncaught exceptions and promise rejections
- Resource loading failures (images, scripts, stylesheets)
- Network request failures
- Third-party service integration errors

### Business and User Impact Metrics

**User Engagement Metrics**
- Bounce rate correlation with page load times

**Revenue Impact Tracking**
```python
# Example: Correlating performance with business metrics
class PerformanceBusinessImpact:
    def calculate_revenue_impact(self, performance_data, revenue_data):
        """Calculate revenue impact of performance changes"""
        
        # Group data by performance buckets
        fast_sessions = revenue_data.filter(load_time < 2.0)
        medium_sessions = revenue_data.filter(load_time >= 2.0, load_time < 5.0)
        slow_sessions = revenue_data.filter(load_time >= 5.0)
        
        # Calculate conversion rates
        fast_conversion = fast_sessions.conversions / fast_sessions.total
        medium_conversion = medium_sessions.conversions / medium_sessions.total
        slow_conversion = slow_sessions.conversions / slow_sessions.total
        
        # Estimate revenue impact
        potential_revenue = slow_sessions.total * fast_conversion * average_order_value
        actual_revenue = slow_sessions.conversions * average_order_value
        lost_revenue = potential_revenue - actual_revenue
        
        return {
            'conversion_rates': {
                'fast': fast_conversion,
                'medium': medium_conversion,
                'slow': slow_conversion
            },
            'estimated_monthly_loss': lost_revenue * 30
        }
```

## Tools and Techniques

The website monitoring landscape offers various tools and approaches, each with specific strengths:

### Real-Time Monitoring Services

## Automated Alerts and Notifications

Effective monitoring requires intelligent alerting that reduces noise while ensuring critical issues get immediate attention:

### Alert Channel Strategy

**Multi-Channel Approach**
```javascript
// Example alert routing logic
const alertRouting = {
  critical: ['slack', 'discord', 'email', 'sms', 'phone'],
  high: ['slack', 'discord', 'email'],
  medium: ['slack', 'email'],
  low: ['email'],
  
  // Business hours vs. after-hours routing
  getChannelsForSeverity: (severity, isBusinessHours) => {
    const baseChannels = alertRouting[severity];
    
    if (!isBusinessHours && severity === 'critical') {
      // Add phone calls for critical after-hours issues
      return [...baseChannels, 'phone_call'];
    }
    
    return baseChannels;
  }
};
```

**Escalation Policies**
Implement time-based escalation to ensure issues get resolved:

1. **Immediate** (0 min): Primary on-call engineer via Slack/Discord
2. **Escalation 1** (5 min): Secondary engineer and team lead via email/SMS
3. **Escalation 2** (15 min): Engineering manager and stakeholders
4. **Escalation 3** (30 min): Executive team and emergency procedures

### Smart Alert Configuration

**Threshold-Based Alerts**
```yaml
# Example alert configuration
alerts:
  response_time:
    warning: 2000ms
    critical: 5000ms
    evaluation_window: 3_checks
    
  uptime:
    critical: 1_failure
    evaluation_window: 1_check
    
  ssl_certificate:
    warning: 30_days_before_expiry
    critical: 7_days_before_expiry
    check_frequency: daily
```

**Anomaly-Based Alerts**
Move beyond static thresholds to intelligent anomaly detection:
- Traffic pattern deviations
- Response time trends
- Error rate anomalies
- Seasonal pattern recognition
