# exit1.dev vs UptimeRobot: Migration Checklist

UptimeRobot’s “free” tier is a museum exhibit: 5-minute checks, limited monitors, and paywalled alerts. exit1.dev gives you the full uptime stack for free. Here’s the practical migration plan—no fluff.

## 1. Inventory the monitors you actually need

Export your UptimeRobot monitors. Cull the dead ones, keep the URLs that matter, and add the ones you skipped because of limits. exit1.dev has no cap, so bring everything.

## 2. Group monitors by intent

Tag monitors in exit1.dev by product, region, and alerting channel. It keeps analytics clean and makes migrations easier next time.

## 3. Recreate monitors with better checks

- Use 1-minute intervals for your revenue endpoints.
- Add keyword or JSON validation to stop false positives.
- Monitor SSL and domain expiry from the same dashboard.

It’s all in the free tier—no upsell triggers.

## 4. Wire up alerts the right way

UptimeRobot charges for anything beyond email. exit1.dev does not.

- Add email alerts for humans who just need awareness.
- Configure webhooks for PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Slack, or Discord.
- Use our HMAC signatures to secure the automations.

## 5. Import history (optional)

If you need legacy logs, export from UptimeRobot and stash them. exit1.dev keeps history unlimited, so you’ll never have to do this again.

## 6. Update runbooks and on-call docs

Swap out old screenshots and credentials. Document where monitors live, how alerts fire, and how to mute them if maintenance is planned.

## 7. Validate the swap

Run downtime drills. Pause monitors, confirm alerts land, resume. Check analytics to ensure response times look sane.

## Why exit1.dev wins

- Unlimited monitors, 1-minute checks, and SSL/domain coverage in the free tier.
- Logs, analytics, and exports with no retention caps.
- Privacy-first: no trackers, no reselling data.
- Built by people who got sick of “free” meaning crippled.

## FAQs

### Can I automate monitor creation?

Yes. Use the exit1.dev API to create monitors in bulk or sync from infrastructure-as-code.

### Do webhooks support secret validation?

Yes. Every webhook payload includes an HMAC signature. Verify it before running automations.

### How do I compare downtime stats after migrating?

Keep the last month of UptimeRobot data, then rely on exit1.dev analytics. Export CSVs if you need both datasets side-by-side.

### What if I need multi-region checks?

They’re included. No add-on pricing. Turn on global monitoring, compare regions, and adjust your routing.
