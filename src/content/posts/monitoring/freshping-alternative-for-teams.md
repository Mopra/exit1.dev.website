# Freshping Alternative for Teams (Free)

Teams used Freshping because it was simple. It’s gone. You still need shared alerts.

exit1.dev is the straight shot: unlimited monitors, 1‑minute checks, and webhooks. Free.

## What Teams Actually Need

- Shared alert channels (email, Slack, Discord)
- Clear ownership
- Simple setup
- Fast checks

Fancy dashboards are optional. Alerts are not.

## Team Setup in 4 Steps

1. Create a shared account.
2. Add your critical URLs first.
3. Configure alerts by team.
4. Document the playbook.

## Alerting Map Example

- Product: `product@company.com`
- Platform: Slack webhook
- Ops: Discord webhook

One incident. Everyone sees it.

## SEO and Marketing Angle

You can say this on your site:

- “1‑minute uptime monitoring.”
- “Instant alerting to Slack.”
- “Unlimited endpoints tracked.”

It’s simple. It’s true. It sells.

## Comparison: Freshping vs exit1.dev

| Feature | Freshping | exit1.dev |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Monitors | 50 | Unlimited |
| Checks | 1 min | 1 min |
| Team alerts | Basic | Webhooks + email |
| API | ❌ | ✅ |
| Price | Free (ending) | Free |

## When to Add Paid Tools

If you need synthetic transactions or real‑user monitoring, add those later. Keep uptime simple and free.

## Conclusion

Freshping’s shutdown doesn’t have to slow your team.
