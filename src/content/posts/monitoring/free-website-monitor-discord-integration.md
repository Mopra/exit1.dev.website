# Free Website Monitor with Discord Integration: Tell Your Community the Truth First

Discord is the town square for your product. If you let rumor threads explain downtime before you do, you‚Äôre begging for churn. Exit1.dev‚Äôs free website monitor now speaks Discord natively, so you can hit your server with the facts before someone invents a conspiracy theory.

## Why Discord Wins for Outage Alerts

- **Community expects transparency**: Your players, customers, and moderators live in Discord. Meet them there or watch trust evaporate.
- **Channel control**: Post critical incidents in a locked `#status` channel, drip maintenance notes into `#announcements`, and stop the chaos.
- **Automation playground**: Webhook embeds let you flag roles, trigger bot workflows, and format clean status cards without hacking together a bot.

The free plan includes Discord webhooks. No ‚Äúenterprise tier‚Äù bait-and-switch. Use it.

## Wire Exit1.dev to Discord Without Drama

1. **Create a Discord webhook**
   - In the server settings for `#status` (or any channel built for truth), open **Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks** and click **New Webhook**.
   - Give it a name that screams authority‚Äî‚ÄúExit1.dev Monitor‚Äù works.
2. **Copy the webhook URL**
   - Discord hands you a unique URL tied to that channel. Guard it. Anyone with the link can post as you.
3. **Drop it into Exit1.dev**
   - Edit your monitor, open **Notifications**, choose **Discord webhook**, and paste.
   - Tick the events worth broadcasting: downtime, recovery, SSL expiry, performance regression. Don‚Äôt flood the channel with fluff.
4. **Fire a test**
   - Trigger a test alert. If the embed doesn‚Äôt land exactly how you want, tweak now instead of during a live incident.

That‚Äôs the whole integration. No bots, no extra hosting, no excuses.

## Steal This Discord Embed Format

```
{
  "username": "Exit1.dev Monitor",
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "üö® Website Down",
      "description": "`app.exit1.dev` is failing health checks.",
      "color": 15158332,
      "fields": [
        { "name": "Error Rate", "value": "72%" },
        { "name": "Regions", "value": "US-East, EU-West, APAC" }
      ],
      "footer": { "text": "Detected 2025-01-14 10:07 UTC" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Make it your own‚Äîchange colors, drop runbook links, mention roles like `@moderators` when humans need to jump in. The alert should answer ‚Äúwhat, where, now what?‚Äù in one hit.

## Keep Discord Alert Hygiene Tight

- **Lock the status channel**: Only the webhook should post. Chatter belongs in threads, not the main feed.
- **Pin recoveries**: When you fix the issue, pin the recovery embed or start a summary thread. Don‚Äôt leave the last message screaming ‚ÄúDOWN.‚Äù
- **Auto-answer repeat questions**: Use bots (MEE6, Carl-bot) to respond to ‚Äúis the site down?‚Äù with the status post.
- **Archive incident threads**: Keep a read-only archive channel for transparency and postmortems without cluttering live chat.

## Go Beyond Outage Blasts

- **Maintenance countdowns**: Schedule a post 24 hours before planned downtime so your community isn‚Äôt blindsided.
- **Launch updates**: Reuse the webhook to ship changelog snippets or deployment successes. Celebrate the wins.
- **VIP segmentation**: Send premium members a role-specific ping with deeper technical context or compensation instructions.

## When You Outgrow ‚ÄúFree‚Äù

Exit1.dev‚Äôs free website monitor already brings global checks, SSL tracking, and Discord alerts. Upgrade only if you need:

- Voice/SMS paging for hardcore on-call rotations.
- Compliance paperwork that Discord can‚Äôt satisfy.

Until then, keep your money and keep your community informed.
