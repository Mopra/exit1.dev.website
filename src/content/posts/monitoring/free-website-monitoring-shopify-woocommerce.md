# Free Website Monitoring for Shopify and WooCommerce

Shopify and WooCommerce are great until your checkout dies on a Saturday night. The usual “free” monitoring tiers only watch your homepage and nag you to upgrade. exit1.dev actually keeps your store honest without charging you for oxygen.

## Why ecommerce uptime needs more than a ping

Your catalog, cart, and payment gateway live on different URLs. If all you monitor is `/`, you deserve the lost revenue. Real ecommerce monitoring means:

- Watching every high-intent page: collection, product, cart, checkout, order status.
- Validating copy and prices so the CDN doesn’t serve stale promotions.
- Checking SSL certificates and domains before they expire.
- Alerting the right people instantly—marketing, ops, whoever gets paged.

exit1.dev covers the entire surface out of the box. Unlimited URLs, 1-minute checks, and webhook + email alerts that don’t hide behind a paywall.

## How to monitor Shopify with exit1.dev

### 1. Map the routes that make money

List the URLs that fail most often: `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/account/login`, your best sellers, promo landers. Add them all. We don’t cap monitors, so stop rationing.

### 2. Add monitors with keyword checks

For product pages, assert the product name, price snippet, or “Add to cart” button text. That catches liquid template issues before your customers do.

### 3. Watch the checkout APIs

Shopify exposes endpoints for cart updates and payment steps. Point exit1.dev at those JSON responses, set expectations using JSONPath, and we’ll yell when Shopify’s API sneezes.

### 4. Lock down SSL and domains

Enable SSL and domain monitoring so you never wake up to browser warnings. We’ll ping you weeks before expiry, not after the fires start.

### 5. Route alerts like a pro

Create webhooks for PagerDuty or Opsgenie, keep email for marketing, and push context into Slack. exit1.dev signs payloads, so your automations stay safe.

## WooCommerce loves boring infrastructure

WooCommerce lives on your hosting. Downtime comes from plugins, PHP errors, and caching gone wrong. exit1.dev doesn’t care. We hit the pages like a user would and confirm the HTML is what you expect.

### Don’t forget the cron jobs

WooCommerce relies on WP-Cron for subscriptions and fulfillment. Monitor the cron endpoint with exit1.dev so you know when tasks back up.

### Track response times

Our analytics show response-time trends for every monitor. Spot plugin regressions before they trash conversion rates.

## Bundle stores, headless front-ends, and multiple markets

Running Hydrogen, custom Next.js front-ends, or multiple Shopify markets? Add every domain and subdomain. Use tags in exit1.dev to separate locales and campaigns. Unlimited monitors means unlimited segmentation.

## Free beats “free trial”

You don’t need to upgrade to get SSL alerts, JSON checks, or 1-minute probes. exit1.dev’s free website monitor covers it. Spend your budget on ads, not uptime basics.

## FAQs

### Does exit1.dev work with Shopify Plus?

Yes. Monitor storefront and checkout pages, theme previews, and custom functions across regions.

### How do I alert different teams for different stores?

Use monitor-specific webhooks. Send EU store incidents to one Slack channel, US outages to PagerDuty. It’s all included.

### Can I export uptime for clients?

Yes. Analytics and logs export to CSV or hit the API directly. No data caps, no invoices.

### How fast can I get set up?

Minutes. Paste URLs, add optional keyword checks, drop in webhook URLs, done. You can copy monitors from spreadsheets if you want bulk onboarding.
