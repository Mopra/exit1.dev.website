# Freshping Replacement: Free Uptime Monitoring

Freshping was a solid free monitor. It’s shutting down. Your uptime still matters.

This is the replacement playbook. Keep it free. Keep it fast.

## The Replacement Stack

You need three things:

1. Uptime checks
2. SSL expiration alerts
3. Real‑time alerting

exit1.dev handles all three. Free.

## What to Tell Your Customers

This is an opportunity. Turn it into a reliability message.

- “We monitor every endpoint every minute.”
- “We catch outages fast.”
- “We prove uptime with alerts and logs.”

It’s not hype. It’s a system.

## Migration Steps

1. Export your Freshping list (URLs and alert channels).
2. Add them to exit1.dev.
3. Verify alerts with a test outage.
4. Update your docs and onboarding.

## Example: Alert Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.exit1.dev/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Slack","url":"https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."}'
```

## Pricing Reality

Freshping was free. exit1.dev stays free.

If you need paid tools later, add them. Don’t pay for basic uptime.

## Keyword Targets That Actually Work

Use these phrases in your own content:

- Free Freshping alternative
- Freshping replacement
- Free uptime monitoring
- 1‑minute uptime checks

You’re helping users and ranking for the same problem.

## Conclusion

Freshping shutdown doesn’t have to be your outage.
