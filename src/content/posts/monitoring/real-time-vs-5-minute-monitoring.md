# 1-Min vs 5-Min: Speed Matters

5-min outdated. 1-min standard.

## Intervals

- 30s: Real-time (rare free)
- 1 min: Near real (exit1.dev)
- 5 min: Standard free
- 15 min: Basic
- 30+ min: Useless

Interval sets detection speed.

## Cost of Delay

Examples below are illustrative; actual impact varies by business.

E-comm Black Friday: Fail 2:00, 5-min detect 2:05, fix 2:25 (25 min), $50k loss. 1-min: 2:01 detect, 2:21 fix (21 min), saves $40k.

SaaS: DB 10:30, 5-min 10:35, restart 10:37 (7 min), 200 tickets. 1-min 10:31, 10:33 (3 min), 80 tickets.

API: 500s 8 min undetected, cascades. Real-time stops.

Cascade: Fail unnoticed, load shifts, secondary fails, full outage.

1-min catches stage 1, 5-min stage 3.

## Tech

False positives: Not from frequency, from bad config.

Common myth: Long intervals reduce false. Reality: Multi-location, retries do.

exit1.dev:
1. Fail Location A
2. Retry B
3. Wait 30s
4. Confirm C
5. Alert

Network: 5-min low load, 1-min more data for trends.

Data: 5-min 288 points/day, 1-min 1440 (5x).

Benefits: Trends, SLAs, optimization, planning.

## Business

SLA: 99.9% 43 min/mo. 5-min misreports 8-min as 5. 1-min accurate.

Users: Abandon >3s. 5-min allows 4:59 down undetected.

Cost-benefit: Marginal cost vs huge savings.

## Types

Real-time (30s): Payments, trading, critical.

Near (1 min): Most prod, SaaS, e-comm.

Periodic (5+): Internal, dev, non-critical.

## Picker

High-traffic: 1-min.

Dev/staging: 5-min.

Internal: 1-5 min.

APIs: 1-min.

## Practices

Graduated: Critical 1-min, important 2-3, supporting 5, dev 10-15.

Smart alerting: Immediate for payments, delayed for perf.

Infra: Redundant locations, retries, rate limits, monitor the monitor.

## exit1.dev

1-min free all. Why? Modern infra cheap. Every site deserves fast detect. 5-min compromise no more.

False reduction: Multi-location, retries, context, patterns.

Data: Optimize speed, capacity, patterns, intermittents.

## Future

Faster: Edge, serverless, AI false reduction, synthetic realistic.

Adaptive: Adjust by criticality, history, load, impact.

## Conclusion

Choose fast. No regrets.
