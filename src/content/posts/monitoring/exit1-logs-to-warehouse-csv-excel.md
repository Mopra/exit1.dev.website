# Turning exit1.dev Logs into Warehouse-Ready Data

Monitoring data belongs in your warehouse, not in a vendor’s walled garden. exit1.dev makes it painless to export logs and analytics so you can build your own dashboards without paying for yet another tool.

## What you get for free

- Complete request logs with timestamp, region, status, latency, and error details.
- Uptime and response-time analytics for any tag or monitor group.
- Unlimited history so you never lose data.

## Export paths

### CSV/Excel download

From the Logs screen, filter by monitor, timeframe, or status. Export straight to CSV or Excel. Hand it to finance, ops, or whoever needs a spreadsheet.

### API access

Prefer automation? Use the exit1.dev API to pull logs in batches. Paginate through results and load them into BigQuery, Snowflake, or Redshift.

### Scheduled jobs

Set a cron job or serverless function to export daily or hourly. Because the API is free, you can run it as often as you like.

## Warehouse loading tips

- Store raw logs in object storage (S3, GCS) first.
- Use lightweight transforms (dbt, SQL scripts) to aggregate by monitor, status, and region.
- Join with incident tickets or business metrics to show impact.

## Dashboards without upsells

Once the data is in your warehouse, use whatever BI tool you already pay for. Power BI, Looker Studio, Metabase—it all works. exit1.dev doesn’t lock you in.

## FAQs

### Do exports cost extra?

No. Exports, API calls, and history are all part of the free tier.

### How fast is the API?

Fast enough to pull thousands of records per request. Throttle with sensible intervals to avoid hammering yourself.

### Can I filter by tag or status?

Yes. Both the UI export and the API let you filter by tags, status codes, regions, and time windows.

### Is there a retention limit?

No. We keep your data. Delete it if you want, but we won’t force you.
