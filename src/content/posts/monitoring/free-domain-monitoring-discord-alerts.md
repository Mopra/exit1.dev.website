# Free Domain Monitoring with Discord Alerts: Don‚Äôt Let Your URL Slip Away

Lose a domain and everything collapses‚Äîsite, email, API endpoints, trust. Exit1.dev‚Äôs free domain monitoring plus Discord alerts keeps expiry warnings front and center for the people who actually care about your brand. If your ops crew camps in Slack instead, swap in the [Slack domain workflow](/blog/free-domain-monitoring-slack-alerts) so the message still lands where they work.

## Why Discord Is a Smart Domain Watchtower

- **Server-wide visibility**: Pin warnings in `#status` or `#ops` so moderators and engineers know the clock is ticking.
- **Role mentions**: Ping `@ops` and `@finance` simultaneously. The folks with the credit cards can‚Äôt pretend they didn‚Äôt see it. Tie those mentions to the same owners who track certificates in [our free SSL email playbook](/blog/free-ssl-monitoring-email-alerts) so renewal work stays aligned.
- **Automation friendly**: Use bots to log alerts, open tickets, or DM the on-call engineer. Discord isn‚Äôt just memes‚Äîit‚Äôs process.

## Set Up the Integration

1. **Create a Discord webhook**
   - In the status channel settings, open **Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks** and create one named ‚ÄúExit1.dev Domain Monitor.‚Äù
2. **Configure Exit1.dev**
   - Add every domain to Exit1.dev. Under **Notifications**, choose **Discord webhook**, paste the URL, and enable warning + expired events.
3. **Fire a test alert**
   - Trigger a test to confirm the embed lands cleanly. It should show domain, expiry, registrar, and runbook link without extra clicks.

## Embed Blueprint

```
{
  "username": "Exit1.dev Domain Monitor",
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "üö© Domain Expiry Warning",
      "description": "`exit1.dev` expires in 21 days.",
      "color": 15105570,
      "fields": [
        { "name": "Registrar", "value": "Namecheap" },
        { "name": "Next Step", "value": "Renew or extend term" }
      ],
      "footer": { "text": "Check again: 2025-01-20 09:00 UTC" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Mention roles, drop registrar URLs, and add staging vs. production tags. The embed should scream urgency.

## Build the Renewal Muscle

- **Thread the work**: First response claims the renewal. Track registrar logins, approvals, and confirmation numbers in-thread.
- **Set reminders**: Use `/remind` or a bot to ping the thread at 7 days, 3 days, and 24 hours pre-expiry. Redundancy prevents failure. Pair those reminders with your [uptime incident drills](/blog/free-uptime-monitor-checklist) so domain, SSL, and availability reviews happen together.
- **Verify success**: After renewal, run a DNS check and post the new expiry date. Proof beats optimism.
- **Update docs**: Link to your domain inventory or CMDB. Keep everything aligned.

## When to Go Beyond Free

Exit1.dev already covers unlimited domain monitors and Discord alerts. Upgrade only if you need:

- Automated registrar integrations with approval workflows.
- Portfolio management for dozens of brands.
- Compliance attestations that auditors obsess over.

Otherwise, keep your money and keep your domains.

## Act Today

1. Inventory production, staging, and marketing domains.
2. Drop them into Exit1.dev and attach the Discord webhook.
3. Run a renewal drill so nobody blanks when the warning hits.

Handle this now or start budgeting to buy your own name back from a squatter.
