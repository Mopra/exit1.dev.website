# The Ultimate Free Uptime Monitor Checklist

If you're shopping for a free uptime monitor, stop wasting time on marketing fluff. Run every vendor through this checklist. If they fail even one must-have, cut them loose. Downtime is expensive, excuses are worthless.

1. [Baseline Requirements](#baseline-requirements)
2. [Advanced Monitoring Capabilities](#advanced-monitoring-capabilities)
3. [Alerting And Incident Response](#alerting-and-incident-response)
4. [Governance And Compliance Considerations](#governance-and-compliance-considerations)

## Baseline Requirements

These are table stakes. You wouldn't ship code without tests. Don't adopt a free uptime monitor that can't clear this bar.

### 1. Check Frequency And Locations
- **Sub-minute checks**: Anything slower than 60 seconds misses the ugly blips that enrage customers.
- **Global probes**: US, EU, APAC. No geodiversity, no deal.
- **Failover logic**: Confirmation from a second region before it wakes you up at 3 a.m.

### 2. Unlimited Monitors (Or A Path To Grow)
- **Baseline**: Ten monitors minimum or you can't cover a real product.
- **Better**: Unlimited checks even if cadence varies by tier.
- **Bonus**: Bulk editing through tags or folders so you aren't stuck clicking like it's 2009.

### 3. Transparent Data Retention
- **Minimum**: 30 days of logs. Anything less is amateur hour.
- **Ideal**: A full year for audits and blame-free postmortems.
- **Why it matters**: When a VP asks "What happened in Q1?" you need receipts.

### 4. Protocol Coverage
- **HTTP(S)** for the obvious web front.
- **TCP & Ping** for services behind the curtain.
- **Cron & Scheduled Tasks** because background jobs break more than you'd like to admit.

## Advanced Monitoring Capabilities

Once the basics are locked, demand the extras that make a free uptime monitor actually useful as you scale.

### 5. Content And Keyword Verification
- Kill "false green" states where the server smiles but the page screams error.
- Screenshot or DOM checks keep fancy front-ends honest.

### 6. Transaction Monitoring Light
- Even a free tier should fake a login or checkout.
- Two synthetic steps beat zero visibility into revenue paths.

### 7. API Observability
- Open REST or GraphQL endpoints with sane rate limits.
- Webhooks or Zapier support so you can automate without a ransom note.

### 8. Integrations Marketplace
- Slack, Teams, PagerDuty. Non-negotiable.
- Extra credit for Discord, SMS, and raw webhooks when you need custom glue.

## Alerting And Incident Response

Monitoring that doesn't alert fast is busywork. Demand decisive incident tooling.

### 9. Multi-Channel Alerts
- Email only? That's negligence. Require email plus webhook at minimum.
- SMS or push options should exist, even if they're throttled.

### 10. Escalation Policies
- Different severity, different humans. Make the tool understand shifts and weekends.
- Calendar-based rotations or bust.

### 11. Status Page Publishing
- Built-in status pages save you from another vendor.
- Custom domains and branding keep customers calm during chaos.

### 12. Incident Templates
- Pre-written updates mean you're communicating in minutes, not hours.
- RSS or webhook broadcast keeps stakeholders looped without manual spam.

## Governance And Compliance Considerations

Regulators don't care that it's free. Your free uptime monitor still has to respect compliance.

### 13. SLA and SLO Tracking
- Set targets, watch burn rates, export the evidence.
- Monthly reviews should be a click, not a spreadsheet marathon.

### 14. Role-Based Access Control
- Viewer, editor, admin. Anything less invites accidents.
- Audit logs must track who touched monitors and when.

### 15. Data Residency And Privacy
- Know where data lives to stay on the right side of GDPR and SOC 2.
- Access to DPAs on the free tier shows the vendor isn't hiding behind legalese.
