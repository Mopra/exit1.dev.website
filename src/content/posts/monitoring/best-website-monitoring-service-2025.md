## Free vs Paid: When to Upgrade {#free-vs-paid-analysis}

The eternal question: when do you need to pay for monitoring?

### Stick with Free When:
- **Personal projects** or side hustles
- **Small sites** with low traffic
- **Basic monitoring needs** (just up/down status)
- **Limited budget** for tools
- **Testing** monitoring services before committing

### Upgrade to Paid When:
- **Business-critical applications** where downtime costs money
- **Team collaboration** needs (multiple users, shared dashboards)
- **Advanced alerting** requirements (SMS, phone calls, escalation)
- **Faster detection** needs (sub-minute monitoring)
- **Professional status pages** for customer communication
- **Compliance requirements** (SLA reporting, audit trails)

### The Cost of Free Monitoring

Let's be honest about trade-offs:

**5-minute checks** can miss outages lasting 3-4 minutes. For an e-commerce site processing $1000/hour, that's $50-80 in lost revenue that faster paid monitoring could prevent.

**Limited alerting** means you might not get notified during critical outages. The cost of being unreachable during a midnight outage often exceeds monthly monitoring fees.

**Basic features** mean you'll eventually hit limits and need to migrate. Migration complexity and potential gaps in monitoring often cost more than upgrading earlier.
