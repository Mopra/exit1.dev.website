# Free SSL Monitoring with Discord Alerts: Stop Serving Scary Warnings

Your community doesn‚Äôt care why the SSL certificate died‚Äîthey just see Chrome screaming ‚ÄúNot Secure‚Äù and bail. Plug Exit1.dev‚Äôs free SSL monitoring into Discord and you‚Äôll know about expiring certs before the mob forms.

## Why Discord Works for SSL Alerts

- **Real-time transparency**: Post expiry countdowns in a locked `#status` channel. Users see you‚Äôre on it, not asleep.
- **Role mentions**: Ping `@infrastructure` or `@mods` the second a warning hits. Accountability in plain sight.
- **Automation hooks**: Use bots to log the alert, create tickets, or DM the on-call engineer. Discord isn‚Äôt just memes‚Äîit‚Äôs workflows.

## Configure the Integration

1. **Make a Discord webhook**
   - In server settings for your status channel, open **Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks** and create one named ‚ÄúExit1.dev SSL Monitor.‚Äù
2. **Add it to Exit1.dev**
   - Create SSL monitors for each domain. Under **Notifications**, choose **Discord webhook**, paste the URL, and enable expiry warnings and expired alerts.
3. **Test aggressively**
   - Trigger a test alert. If the embed isn‚Äôt crystal clear, fix it now. You want domain, expiry date, and next steps at a glance.

## Recommended Discord Embed

```
{
  "username": "Exit1.dev SSL Monitor",
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "üîí SSL Expiry Warning",
      "description": "`cdn.exit1.dev` certificate expires in 10 days.",
      "color": 3447003,
      "fields": [
        { "name": "Issuer", "value": "Let's Encrypt R3" },
        { "name": "Next Step", "value": "Run renewal playbook" }
      ],
      "footer": { "text": "Check again: 2025-01-15 08:00 UTC" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Add role mentions, runbook links, or staging vs. production tags. The embed should make the response plan obvious.

## Drive the Renewal Process

- **Assign ownership in-thread**: First responder claims the renewal. Threads show progress without flooding the main channel.
- **Schedule follow-ups**: Use bots or `/remind` to nag the team three days before expiry. No more ‚Äúforgot.‚Äù
- **Automate verification**: Have your CI/CD pipeline post back to the thread once the new cert is live.
- **Document closure**: Post the new expiry date and any lessons learned. Transparency earns trust.

## When Free Is Enough

Exit1.dev already gives you unlimited SSL monitors, Discord alerts, and status pages without charging a cent. Upgrade only if you need:

- Enterprise PKI integrations.
- Multi-tenant reporting for regulated industries.
- Dedicated support contracts.

Otherwise, the free stack plus discipline keeps certificates fresh.

## Do It Now

1. Inventory every domain hitting production.
2. Create SSL monitors in Exit1.dev with the Discord webhook attached.
3. Run a renewal drill so the team knows the play.

Your community deserves green padlocks, not panic screens. Handle it.
