## Setting Up exit1.dev for Development Workflows

### Quick Start with CLI

```bash
# Install exit1.dev CLI (if available)
npm install -g exit1-cli

# Add your first website
exit1 add https://yourwebsite.com

# Check status
exit1 status

# Get monitoring data as JSON
exit1 status --json
```

### API Integration Example

```javascript
// Add website via API
const response = await fetch('https://api.exit1.dev/websites', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://yourwebsite.com',
    name: 'My Website',
    checkInterval: 60
  })
});

// Get monitoring data
const status = await fetch('https://api.exit1.dev/websites/YOUR_SITE_ID/status');
const data = await status.json();
```

### Webhook Setup for CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: Monitor Website
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Every 5 minutes

jobs:
  check-website:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check website status
        run: |
          curl -f https://yourwebsite.com || \
          curl -X POST https://api.exit1.dev/webhooks/downtime \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"url":"https://yourwebsite.com","status":"down"}'
```

## Advanced Developer Features

### Custom HTTP Headers

```javascript
// Monitor API endpoints with authentication
const monitoringConfig = {
  url: 'https://api.yourwebsite.com/health',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'User-Agent': 'exit1-monitor/1.0'
  },
  expectedStatus: 200,
  timeout: 30
};
```

### SSL Certificate Monitoring

```bash
# Check SSL certificate expiration
exit1 ssl https://yourwebsite.com

# Get certificate details
exit1 ssl --details https://yourwebsite.com
```

### Response Time Monitoring

```javascript
// Monitor specific performance thresholds
const performanceConfig = {
  url: 'https://yourwebsite.com',
  maxResponseTime: 2000, // 2 seconds
  alertOnSlow: true,
  trackPercentiles: [50, 95, 99]
};
```

## Integration with Development Tools

### Docker Compose Setup

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  website-monitor:
    image: exit1/monitor:latest
    environment:
      - API_KEY=${EXIT1_API_KEY}
      - WEBSITES=${WEBSITE_URLS}
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: website-monitor
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: website-monitor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: website-monitor
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: monitor
        image: exit1/monitor:latest
        env:
        - name: API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: exit1-secret
              key: api-key
```

## Best Practices for Developer Monitoring

### 1. Automate Everything

- Use scripts to add new websites automatically
- Integrate monitoring into your deployment pipeline
- Set up automated alert routing based on team roles

### 2. Monitor What Matters

- Focus on critical user journeys
- Monitor API endpoints, not just homepage
- Track SSL certificate expiration
- Monitor third-party service dependencies

### 3. Use Webhooks Effectively

```javascript
// Custom webhook handler
app.post('/webhook/website-down', (req, res) => {
  const { url, status, responseTime } = req.body;
  
  // Send to Slack
  slack.send(`ðŸš¨ ${url} is ${status} (${responseTime}ms)`);
  
  // Create GitHub issue
  github.createIssue({
    title: `Website Down: ${url}`,
    body: `Response time: ${responseTime}ms\nStatus: ${status}`
  });
  
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

### 4. Implement Circuit Breakers

```javascript
// Circuit breaker pattern for monitoring
class MonitoringCircuitBreaker {
  constructor(failureThreshold = 3, timeout = 60000) {
    this.failureThreshold = failureThreshold;
    this.timeout = timeout;
    this.failures = 0;
    this.lastFailureTime = null;
  }
  
  async execute(monitoringFunction) {
    if (this.isOpen()) {
      throw new Error('Circuit breaker is open');
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await monitoringFunction();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
