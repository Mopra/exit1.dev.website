# Downtime: Causes and Kills

Downtime costs. Understand, prevent.

## Costs

Financial: E-comm $100k/hr, SaaS $1m/hr, small biz thousands.

Reputation: 77% don't return, SEO penalties.

Operational: Productivity loss, support burden, stress.

## Causes

1. Hardware Fails
- Drives crash, RAM dies, CPU hot, PSU gone, net card bad.

Prevent: Redundant hardware, health monitoring, cooling, spares, cloud.

2. Software Bugs
- Bad deploys, DB migrations, OS updates, plugin conflicts, leaks.

Prevent: Testing, staging, canary, rollbacks, perf monitoring.

3. Traffic/DDOS
- Viral, campaigns, attacks, bots, sales.

Prevent: Auto-scale, CDNs, DDOS protection, traffic monitoring, capacity planning.

4. DB Issues
- Crashes, corruption, slow queries, disk full, pool exhausted.

Prevent: Backups, optimization, replication, monitoring, pooling.

5. Net/DNS
- ISP out, DNS fail, routing bad, cable cuts, config errors.

Prevent: Multi DNS, geo failover, net monitoring, multi ISPs, audits.

6. Security
- Malware, ransomware, SQL injection, XSS, brute force.

Prevent: Updates, auth, WAF, audits, training.

7. Human Error
- Deletes, config bad, wrong env deploys, query mistakes, firewall mess.

Prevent: Change mgmt, auto deploys, reviews, doc, training.

8. Third-Party
- Payment out, CDN issues, cloud disrupts, rate limits, cert expires.

Prevent: Diversify, degradation, monitor status, backup payments, auto renew.

9. Resource Exhaust
- Disk full, memory out, CPU 100%, bandwidth sat, DB connections max.

Prevent: Resource monitoring, alerts, auto-scale, cleanup, optimize.

10. Environmental
- Power out, disasters, construction, weather, instability.

Prevent: Redundant power, geo distribution, recovery plans, multi-cloud, backups.

## Prevention

Layered: Infra, monitoring, auto response, maintenance.

### Infra

Redundancy:
```
Primary DC (US-East)
├── LB (2x)
├── Web (3x)
├── DB Cluster (Master + 2 Slaves)
└── Backup (UPS + Gen)

Secondary DC (US-West)
├── Standby
├── Real-time Rep
└── Auto Failover
```

### Monitoring

exit1.dev: 1-min, global, intelligent alerts.

Uptime: 1-min multi-location, HTTP/HTTPS, SSL, DNS.

Perf: Response, load, DB queries, CDN/static.

Biz: Journeys, APIs, payments, search.

### Auto Response

Scale on traffic, failover backups, health removal, cache warming.

Alerts: Immediate critical, escalation.

### Maintenance

Security updates, DB opt, log clean, health checks.

Recovery tests: Monthly failover, backup restore, net failover, comm practice.

## Checklist

- Redundancy
- Monitoring
- Backups

## exit1.dev

Detects 1-min, global, alerting. Data for patterns.

Alerting: Multi-location, retries, contextual, integrations.

Coverage: Website, API, SSL, DNS.

## Response Plan

Prep: Doc systems, contacts, channels, roles.

Detect: Alerts, reports, notifications, escalation.

Response: Assess, mobilize, update status, investigate.

Recovery: Restore confirm, monitor perf, communicate res, analyze.

Learn: Root cause, improvements, training, monitoring enhance.

## Measure

Availability: Uptime %, MTTD, MTTR, incidents/mo.

Perf: Response avg, load trends, error %, UX scores.

Biz: Revenue lost, satisfaction, tickets, retention.

Improve: Monthly reviews, quarterly assessments, annual plans, evaluations.

## Conclusion

Prevent > react.

exit1.dev foundation. 1-min, global, intelligent. With planning, response, learning, high availability.

Goal: Minimize frequency, duration, learn.
