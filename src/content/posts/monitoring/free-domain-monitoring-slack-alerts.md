# Free Domain Monitoring with Slack Alerts: Stop Losing Domains Like Amateurs

Letting a domain expire is the fastest way to light your brand on fire. Customers can’t reach you, email breaks, and some squatter buys the name before you wake up. Exit1.dev’s free domain monitoring with Slack alerts keeps the countdown in everyone’s face.

## Why Slack Works for Domain Renewals

- **Public pressure**: When `#platform` sees a domain expiring in 15 days, someone will jump on it.
- **Threaded coordination**: Track registrar logins, approvals, and payment receipts in one thread.
- **Workflow automation**: Trigger renewal checklists or ticket creation with Slack reactions and Workflow Builder.

## Configure Domain Alerts in Slack

1. **Spin up a Slack webhook**
   - Use [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to point alerts at a channel like `#domain-ops` or straight into `#infrastructure` if you want maximum visibility.
2. **Create domain monitors**
   - In Exit1.dev, add each domain you own. Under **Notifications**, choose **Slack webhook**, paste the URL, and enable “Domain expiry warning” and “Domain expired.”
3. **Test the flow**
   - Send a test alert. Adjust the copy until it shows the domain, registrar, and renewal deadline without scrolling.

## Sample Slack Domain Alert

```
:triangular_flag_on_post: *Domain Expiry Warning*
Domain: exit1.dev
Registrar: Namecheap
Expires in: 30 days
Renewal playbook: https://runbooks.exit1.dev/domain-renewal
Owner: ops@yourcompany.com
```

Make it obvious who needs to pay the invoice. Add billing links if your registrar supports direct renewals.

## Lock In a Renewal Routine

- **Assign an owner instantly**: First reply in the thread takes the task. No ghosting.
- **Confirm payment**: Drop a screenshot or invoice number once the registrar renews the domain.
- **Schedule sanity checks**: Use `/remind` to ping the channel seven days before expiry and again 24 hours before. Redundancy saves careers.
- **Update documentation**: Post the new expiry date to your asset tracker or CMDB right in the thread.

## When Free Monitoring Is Enough

Exit1.dev covers unlimited domain monitors, Slack alerts, and global uptime checks. Pay extra only if you need:

- Registrar API automation across dozens of brands.
- Compliance workflows with mandatory approvals.
- Managed domain portfolios.

Otherwise, Slack plus discipline keeps your names safe.

## Take Action Now

1. List every domain you rely on—prod, staging, marketing microsites.
2. Add them to Exit1.dev with Slack alerts enabled.
3. Run a renewal tabletop so the team can’t feign surprise.

Do it and you’ll never again explain to leadership why the homepage now hosts casino ads.
