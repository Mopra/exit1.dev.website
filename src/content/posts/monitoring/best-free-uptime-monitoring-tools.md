## Why Exit1.dev Beats Limited Free Tiers

Limited tiers tease; Exit1.dev delivers full power free.

## How to Pick: Go Unlimited

For most, Exit1.dev's unlimited wins over capped tiers.

Judge any “free” plan by the constraints they hide. Check how many sites you can watch, how often checks run, and whether alerts actually reach the team before users do. Dig into export options and API limits too—some vendors lock your data behind paywalls. If you need a status page or webhooks, make sure they aren't premium add-ons. A tool is only free if it lets you run real monitoring without nickeling you for basics.

## Maximize Your Monitoring

Focus on critical paths. Use webhooks for auto-fixes.

## The Future: Unlimited Wins

Capped free tiers are dying. Unlimited is the way.

## FAQs

### Are free uptime monitors reliable enough for production?
Most handle basic checks fine, but watch for slow intervals or weak alerting that delay response times.

### Can I use multiple free tools together?
Sure, stack them if you don’t mind duplicate alerts. Just centralize notifications so you can sleep.

### What happens when my site outgrows a free tier?
Either pay up or switch to a service like Exit1.dev that doesn’t throttle you in the first place.

## Conclusion

Free uptime monitoring only matters if it keeps you in the loop without shackles. Exit1.dev does that; the rest make you upgrade when things get interesting.
