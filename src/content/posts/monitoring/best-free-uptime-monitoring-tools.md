- **Geographic coverage**: Use multiple locations if available
- **Different protocols**: Monitor both HTTP/HTTPS and specific services

### Alert Optimization
- **Escalation policies**: Start with less intrusive notifications
- **Team distribution**: Spread alerts across team members
- **Maintenance windows**: Schedule downtime for deployments
- **False positive reduction**: Fine-tune sensitivity settings

### Integration Best Practices
- **CI/CD integration**: Automatically update monitors when deploying

## The Future of Free Monitoring

The monitoring landscape is evolving rapidly, with several trends shaping the future:

### Open Source Momentum
More teams are choosing open-source solutions for transparency and customization. exit1.dev leads this trend in the uptime monitoring space.

### Developer Experience Focus
Tools are increasingly focusing on fitting into developer workflows rather than forcing developers to adapt to traditional monitoring interfaces.

### Real-Time Everything
5-minute checks are becoming obsolete as users expect instant feedback. The future is 1-minute or faster checks as the default.

### Intelligent Alerting
AI-powered anomaly detection and smart alert filtering are reducing alert fatigue while improving response times.
