# SOC 2 and ISO Prep with a Free Website Monitor

Auditors don’t care how much you paid for your uptime tooling. They care that you collect evidence and enforce controls. exit1.dev gives you the monitoring proof you need for SOC 2 and ISO certifications—without an enterprise invoice.

## What auditors look for

- Documented monitoring controls.
- Evidence of uptime tracking and alerting.
- Demonstrable response processes.
- Privacy considerations (no surprise trackers).

exit1.dev checks every box.

## Step 1: Define the control

Write the control: “We monitor production websites and APIs with exit1.dev at 1-minute intervals. Alerts fire to on-call via webhooks and email. Incidents are logged in {your system}.” Done.

## Step 2: Capture monitoring configuration

Screenshot or export your monitor list. Tag monitors by system so auditors see coverage. Because exit1.dev keeps everything accessible, you can export at will.

## Step 3: Prove alerting works

Pull webhook delivery logs or email history. The alert payloads include timestamps, URLs, status, and regions—exactly what auditors expect. Pair them with PagerDuty/Opsgenie incident IDs.

## Step 4: Show incident handling

Link downtime alerts to your incident tickets. exit1.dev timestamps everything, so lining up response timelines is trivial.

## Step 5: Demonstrate privacy

We don’t run trackers, analytics beacons, or ads. Share our data privacy statement with auditors. Monitoring shouldn’t leak customer data.

## Step 6: Archive reports

Export uptime analytics and logs quarterly. Store them in your audit evidence repo. 90 days retention max means you’re never scrambling to pull logs before they disappear.

## Bonus: Automation

Use our API to dump monitor configs, uptime stats, and log entries straight into your GRC tooling. Schedule it monthly and you’re done.
