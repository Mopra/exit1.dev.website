# Free Incident Management with exit1.dev: The Pragmatic Stack

Incident management is supposed to be ruthless about downtime, not budgets. exit1.dev gives you the critical pieces—detection, context, communication—without bloated enterprise tooling. Here’s how to stand up a free incident management practice that actually works.

## Anchor everything in precise detection

If your monitors are sloppy, your incident response will be sloppy. Configure exit1.dev uptime checks across core API endpoints, login flows, and external dependencies. Use:

- **1-minute probes** for customer-facing surfaces.
- **Synthetic transactions** on checkout and onboarding flows.
- **Regional redundancy** so you know if the failure is local or global.

Pair these with the [free uptime monitor checklist](/blog/free-uptime-monitor-checklist) to make sure coverage is complete.

## Make alerts impossible to ignore

Free incident management fails when alerts arrive late or disappear in inbox sludge. exit1.dev already pumps notifications to Slack, email, Discord, and webhooks. Wire the webhooks into PagerDuty or Opsgenie if you already use them. Otherwise, drive Slack first responders with:

1. A dedicated `#incident-response` channel.
2. Exit1.dev webhook posts that tag the on-call role.
3. A pinned playbook linking to [real-time vs 5-minute monitoring](/blog/real-time-vs-5-minute-monitoring) so nobody debates polling frequency mid-incident.

## Keep the war room async-friendly

Not everyone can hop on a Zoom immediately. Log every update in the incident channel. exit1.dev’s alert history gives a timeline with zero effort. Drop charts and logs straight from the dashboard so product and support stay in sync.

- Snapshot the response-time graphs the moment the incident starts.
- Paste log exports with timestamps for engineers jumping in late.
- Quote customer-impact details pulled from [incident postmortem templates](/blog/incident-postmortem-templates-with-exit1).

## Automate the close-out, not the thinking

When the smoke clears, use exit1.dev to export the incident window. Attach it to your postmortem doc and assign follow-ups. The platform keeps seven days of detailed logs on the free plan, so download them before they roll off. If you need a deeper audit trail, push the data into a warehouse using the [Exit1 logs to warehouse guide](/blog/exit1-logs-to-warehouse-csv-excel).

## The uncompromising baseline

Free incident management isn’t about duct-taping tools. It’s about demanding observability, alerting, and accountability without surrendering the budget. exit1.dev hands you that baseline. Stop waiting for a procurement cycle—set up the monitors today, wire the alerts, and run your next incident with receipts instead of guesswork.
