# AI Detection: Catch Issues Before They Explode

Traditional monitoring waits for fires. Dumb. AI predicts them. If you're still wrestling with manual thresholds, revisit our [Monitoring 101 primer](/blog/website-monitoring-101) to see exactly where classic uptime checks fall short before layering in smarter detection. At exit1.dev, we're baking this in because devs deserve tools that think ahead.

## Traditional Sucks

Thresholds are blind. Slow creep? No alert until boom.

- Static crap ignores patterns
- Misses gradual fails
- Alert storms from spikes
- React after users rage

## AI Actually Fixes It

Learns normal, flags weird. No more babysitting.

### Pattern Hunting

- Builds baselines from your mess
- Knows peak vs midnight
- Correlates metrics like a boss

### Predict Problems

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

def detect_anomalies(times, errors, traffic):
    data = np.column_stack([times, errors, traffic])
    model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
    model.fit(data)
    return model.predict(data)  # -1 = trouble ahead
```

Run this. Fix before users notice.

## Real Wins

E-comm site: AI caught DB bloat pre-Black Friday. Saved outage. API errors creeping? Nailed early. Pair the models with disciplined alerting like our [real-time vs five-minute strategy](/blog/real-time-vs-5-minute-monitoring) so teams act on the signal fast.

## Our Plan at exit1.dev

Phase 1: Smart baselines. Phase 2: Predictions. Phase 3: Auto-fixes.

We’re starting with raw data because fancy models without clean inputs are bullshit. First pass builds a baseline from every request and response to learn what “normal” actually means. Then we feed that into models that forecast spikes or slow burns before anyone files a ticket. The endgame? When the model is dead sure your DB will choke at 3 p.m., it reroutes traffic or rolls back a bad deploy without waiting for approval. Less heroics, more uptime. Want the human workflows to keep pace? Wire the predictions into channels built for action—our [Slack incident playbook](/blog/free-uptime-monitor-slack-integration) shows how to keep engineers aligned when the AI raises its hand.

## Do It Now

Collect clean data. Review weekly. Track beyond up/down. If you need a framework for the day-to-day grind, follow the automation loop in [AI integration for monitoring](/blog/ai-integration-for-website-monitoring) to connect signals to remediation without adding chaos.

## Traps to Dodge

Bad data in = bad data out. Explain AI calls, or team ignores. Roll slow.

## FAQs

### How much data do I need for AI anomaly detection?
You need weeks of clean metrics to teach the model what normal looks like. Feed it junk and it'll scream at ghosts.

### Can AI monitoring replace humans?
No. It handles the grunt work, but you still need someone to act on the alerts and tune the thresholds.

### What if the model flags false positives?
Adjust sensitivity and retrain with better samples. False alarms beat silent failures.

## Conclusion

AI anomaly detection turns monitoring from passive logging into early warning. Hook it up or keep firefighting while your competition stays online.
