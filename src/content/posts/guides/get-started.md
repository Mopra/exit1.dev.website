### Slack Integration

**Slack Webhook Setup:**
1. Go to your Slack workspace settings
2. Navigate to **Apps** â†’ **Manage** â†’ **Custom Integrations**
3. Create an **Incoming Webhook** for your alerts channel
4. Copy the webhook URL

```bash
exit1 alert add-channel slack \
  --name "Engineering Alerts" \
  --webhook-url "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../..." \
  --channel "#alerts" \
  --severity "critical,high" \
  --mention-channel "critical"
```

**Slack Alert Examples:**
```json
{
  "text": "ðŸš¨ Website Down Alert",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "color": "danger",
      "fields": [
        {"title": "Service", "value": "Main Website", "short": true},

  --webhook-url "https://api.yourapp.com/incidents" \
  --method "POST" \
  --headers "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  --headers "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Step 4: Set Up Alert Rules and Escalation

### Basic Alert Configuration

**Alert Thresholds:**
```yaml
# Response time alerts
response_time_alerts:
  warning: 2000ms    # 2 seconds
  critical: 5000ms   # 5 seconds
  
# Uptime alerts
uptime_alerts:
  critical: 1_consecutive_failure
  warning: 2_failures_in_5_minutes

# SSL certificate alerts
ssl_alerts:
  warning: 30_days_before_expiry
  critical: 7_days_before_expiry
```

**Creating Alert Rules:**
```bash
# Response time rule
exit1 alert add-rule \
  --name "Slow Response Time" \
  --condition "response_time > 3000" \
  --severity "high" \
  --channels "slack,email"

# Uptime rule
exit1 alert add-rule \
  --name "Service Down" \
  --condition "status != 200" \
  --severity "critical" \
  --channels "slack,discord,sms" \
  --escalation-delay 300
```

### Escalation Policies

**Time-Based Escalation:**
```bash
exit1 alert add-escalation \
  --name "Critical Service Escalation" \
  --steps "
    0min: slack:#alerts,email:team@company.com
    5min: sms:+1234567890,email:manager@company.com
    15min: phone:+1234567890,email:exec@company.com
    30min: all-channels,email:emergency@company.com
  "
```

**Business Hours Configuration:**
```bash
exit1 alert set-business-hours \
  --timezone "America/New_York" \
  --weekdays "monday-friday" \
  --hours "09:00-17:00" \
  --escalation-modifier "
    business-hours: normal-escalation
    after-hours: immediate-critical-only
  "
```

## Step 5: Monitor Performance and Optimization

### Dashboard Monitoring

**Real-time Status Overview:**
- **Green indicators**: All services operational
- **Yellow indicators**: Performance warnings or degraded service
- **Red indicators**: Service outages or critical issues
- **Response time graphs**: Historical performance trends

**Key Metrics to Track:**
```javascript
// Performance metrics dashboard
const performanceMetrics = {
  uptime: {
    current: "99.95%",
    target: "99.9%",
    monthly: "99.97%"
  },
  responseTime: {
    average: "250ms",
    p95: "450ms",
    p99: "800ms"
  },
  errorRate: {
    current: "0.02%",
    target: "<0.1%",
    trend: "decreasing"
  }
};
```

### Performance Analysis

**Identifying Trends:**
1. **Weekly patterns** - Traffic and performance variations
2. **Seasonal changes** - Holiday traffic spikes or dips
3. **Deployment impact** - Performance changes after releases
4. **Geographic variations** - Regional performance differences

**Optimization Opportunities:**
```bash
# Generate performance report
exit1 report generate \
  --period "last-30-days" \
  --metrics "uptime,response-time,error-rate" \
  --format "pdf" \
  --email "team@company.com"

# Analyze slow periods
exit1 analyze performance \
  --threshold "response-time > 2000ms" \
  --period "last-week" \
  --group-by "hour,day"
```

### Automated Optimization

**Performance Alerts:**
Set up alerts for gradual performance degradation:

```bash
exit1 alert add-rule \
  --name "Performance Degradation" \
  --condition "avg_response_time_1hour > baseline * 1.5" \
  --severity "medium" \
  --channels "slack" \
  --description "Response time trending upward"
```

**Capacity Planning:**
Use monitoring data for infrastructure decisions:

```python
# Example capacity planning analysis
class CapacityPlanning:
    def analyze_traffic_trends(self, monitoring_data):
        """Analyze traffic patterns for capacity planning"""
        
        # Calculate growth trends
        monthly_growth = self.calculate_growth_rate(monitoring_data.traffic)
        peak_load_patterns = self.identify_peak_periods(monitoring_data.response_times)
        
        # Predict future needs
        projected_traffic = self.project_traffic(monthly_growth, 6)  # 6 months
        recommended_scaling = self.calculate_scaling_needs(projected_traffic)
        
        return {
            'current_capacity_utilization': '75%',
            'projected_6month_needs': recommended_scaling,
            'recommended_actions': [
                'Scale server capacity by 30% before Q4',
                'Optimize database queries for peak load',
                'Consider CDN for static assets'
            ]
        }
```

## Step 6: Advanced Configuration and Best Practices

### Multi-Location Monitoring

**Geographic Coverage:**
```bash
exit1 add https://mywebsite.com \
  --name "Global Homepage Check" \
  --locations "us-east,us-west,europe,asia-pacific" \
