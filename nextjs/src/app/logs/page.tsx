    {
      question: "How long do you keep my monitoring logs?",
      answer: "We keep all your monitoring logs indefinitely with no retention limits. Unlike competitors who delete logs after 30-90 days, we believe you should have access to your complete monitoring history for debugging, compliance, and trend analysis."
    },
    {
      question: "What information is included in each log entry?",
      answer: "Each log entry includes timestamp, website/API URL, HTTP status code, response time, error details (if any), SSL certificate information, and any custom validation results. We capture the full context of each monitoring check for comprehensive debugging."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I search and filter my logs?",
      answer: "Yes, you can search logs by website name, URL, status codes, error messages, or time ranges. Filter by specific time periods (24h, 7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all), status types, or individual websites. Our search is fast and works across years of data."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I export my logs?",
      answer: "You can export logs in CSV or Excel format. Select your desired time range and filters, then download the data. We also provide API access to programmatically retrieve logs. There are no limits on export volume or frequency."
    },
    {
      question: "Are logs updated in real-time?",
      answer: "Yes, logs are updated in real-time as monitoring checks complete. You can watch new log entries appear live, making it easy to debug issues as they happen. The interface automatically refreshes to show the latest data."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I view logs for specific time periods?",
      answer: "Absolutely. You can view logs for any time period - from the last hour to years of historical data. Use our time presets (24h, 7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all) or set custom date ranges with our calendar picker."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you store sensitive data in logs?",
      answer: "We only store the information necessary for monitoring - URLs, status codes, response times, and error messages. We don't store request bodies, passwords, or other sensitive data. Your data privacy is protected."
    },
    {
      question: "How do logs help with debugging?",
      answer: "Logs show you exactly when issues occurred, how long they lasted, and what the specific problems were. You can trace performance degradation, identify patterns in failures, and correlate issues across multiple services. This makes debugging much faster and more accurate."
