    {
      question: "How often do you check my websites?",
      answer: "We check your websites as frequently as every 1 minute. You can set intervals of 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 24 hours depending on your needs. Most users start with 5-minute intervals for optimal balance of speed and resource usage."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens when my website goes down?",
      answer: "We immediately detect the issue and send you instant alerts via email and webhooks. You'll know about problems before your users do. Our system tracks downtime duration and automatically resumes monitoring when your site comes back online."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I monitor APIs and authenticated endpoints?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We support all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and custom headers for authentication. You can monitor APIs that require API keys, bearer tokens, or custom authentication headers. We also validate JSON responses to ensure your APIs are returning the expected data."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is your monitoring?",
      answer: "We use multiple global monitoring locations to ensure accuracy. Our system performs real HTTP requests (not just ping) and validates responses. We also implement smart retry logic and alert suppression to prevent false positives from temporary network issues."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you monitor SSL certificates?",
      answer: "Yes, we automatically monitor SSL certificate validity, expiration dates, and security issues. You'll get alerts when certificates are about to expire or have security problems. This is included free with every website you monitor."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I export my monitoring data?",
      answer: "Yes, you can export all your monitoring logs and data via our API or download them as CSV/Excel files. We believe you should own your data, so there are no restrictions on data export or retention limits."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between real-time and 5-minute monitoring?",
      answer: "Real-time monitoring checks every minute, giving you the fastest possible detection of issues. 5-minute monitoring is more resource-efficient and suitable for most websites. Choose based on your uptime requirements and server capacity."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prevent alert spam?",
      answer: "We use intelligent alert suppression that requires multiple consecutive failures before sending alerts. We also limit alerts to one per check per hour to prevent spam. You can customize these settings based on your preferences."
